    "> In the previous tutorial, we improved the retrieval accuracy of the RAG system by optimizing the retrieval strategy, recall strategy, and query rewriting strategy based on large models. However, the final response results still need to be fused and processed by large models. The strength of the model directly affects the final results. This is like a good dish requires not only high-quality ingredients (an optimized retrieval module provides high-matching text), but also a good chef (a capable LLM that fuses information to generate answers). In this tutorial, we will further improve the accuracy of the RAG system, go into the generation module of the RAG system, discuss the role of large models in it, and introduce how to significantly improve the generation capabilities of large models through fine-tuning of LazyLLM, and even use small models to surpass general large models (i.e., train a good chef), thereby improving the reply quality of the RAG system."
