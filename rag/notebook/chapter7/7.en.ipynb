    "In this tutorial, we will first introduce how to evaluate the search component of RAG to help you understand how to measure the search capabilities of a RAG system. Subsequently, we will delve into the implementation of several strategies to improve the performance of the RAG system retrieval component and compare the corresponding effects. The first is to implement the query rewriting strategy based on LazyLLM. Then introduce the concept of Node Group in LazyLLM, learn to use LazyLLM's built-in node group and node group construction method, then introduce several ways to customize node groups, and finally implement a RAG system that uses multiple node groups for document recall by constructing a complex node group tree. Next, we will introduce the impact of retrieval strategies on the recall rate of retrieval components, how to use LazyLLM's Embedding model, how to use built-in similarity (Similarity), and how to use a combination of multiple retrieval strategies. Finally, we will introduce how to use LazyLLM-based similarity threshold filtering. After learning to use multiple retrieval strategies, introduce the LazyLLM reranking component (Reranker) and experience the impact of the two-stage recall and reranking algorithm on the recall context. Finally, we will implement Multi-Path Retrieval RAG based on LazyLLM and combine different strategies to improve the comprehensiveness and accuracy of recall."

For example, cosine similarity is used for documents represented by vectors, and bm25 is used for documents stored in the original text.

When reading the document, corresponding parsing (i.e., parsing) will be performed according to the document type. In this step, the complete document will be parsed according to specific rules to obtain a RAG-friendly format, such as html. Wait for the markup language to perform label cleaning to improve the effectiveness of the text content; finally, apply the same Node Transform to each node to construct a node group.

In the last years of Han Ling Emperor Zhongping's reign, Cheng Gongying began to follow Han Sui and became his confidant. In the 16th year of Jian'an (211), Ma Chao and Han Sui rebelled against Cao Cao, but Han Sui was defeated in Huayin and fled to Huangzhong. His tribe was scattered, and only Cheng Gongying followed. At that time, Han Sui's son-in-law Yan Xing intended to kill Han Sui and surrender, so he attacked Han Sui at night, but failed. Han Sui was extremely frustrated and told Cheng Gongying that he planned to flee to Shu and seek refuge with Liu Bei. However, Cheng Gongying objected and believed that Han Sui should not abandon the base he had established for many years and seek refuge with others. He suggested that Han Sui seek refuge with the Qiang people and wait for an opportunity to make a comeback. |\n",

However, it is limited to preset question and answer pairs and cannot cover all potential problems. The recall coverage may be insufficient. In practice, it is still necessary to combine other node groups to achieve a more comprehensive retrieval. The information of the document summary node group is highly condensed, which can quickly locate the core features of the paragraph and reduce the interference of irrelevant information. It is suitable for querying advanced concepts, but the detailed information is missing and cannot answer specific questions. It also depends on the quality of the summary. If the summary does not cover the key content, the recall effect may be affected. The keyword node group has high recall accuracy and can directly match core keywords to ensure topic relevance. It is suitable for fuzzy queries to ensure that relevant content will not be missed. However, the disadvantage is that contextual information is lost, causing the model to be unable to understand the logical relationship between keywords. It is suitable for scenarios where precise keywords are searched, and can also be used in combination with large models to extract keywords."

    "The sentence node group has the smallest granularity, the information is direct, and can be used for accurate retrieval. It is suitable for queries with strong factuality to avoid information redundancy. However, the disadvantage is that it is too fragmented and difficult to provide context. Multiple sentence combinations may be needed to answer a complete question, and other relevant information may be missed during recall. Usually a sentence in documents such as laws and regulations contains a very large amount of information, which is very suitable for retrieval using sentence node groups. The paragraph summary node group is suitable for high-level overview issues, but the detailed coverage is not comprehensive enough and relies on the summary algorithm. It can usually be used to recall long paragraphs (such as technical documents) with summaries. Methods to use summary or keyword node groups to recall their parent node groups:"

Therefore, using bm25 sparse retrieval based on keyword matching is not as effective as using semantic retrieval. The advantage of semantic retrieval is that it is good at discovering the semantic correlation between texts. Even if the wording used in the two texts is different, the corresponding paragraphs can be found.

The recall and rearrangement strategy is widely used in tasks such as search engines, recommendation systems, and question and answer systems. Its basic idea is: after the initial retrieval, the retrieval results are re-ranked through an additional model to improve the final effect. The figure below compares the process of directly using the retriever to recall the top 3 documents and first recalling the top 5 documents through the retriever and then reordering them to return the top 3 documents. It can be seen that the retrieval process does not sort the documents, but only returns the top 5 documents that meet the requirements.

Or how do I know what type of parameters are passed into the function? The answer is actually very simple. The parameters of the custom Transform algorithm function can be specified by developers themselves, which is very flexible. Here’s a detailed explanation. If the defined function input parameter is of type `str`, then when passing the function into `create_node_group` when using it, you can only specify `transform` as `SentSplitter`, or when specifying `transform`, you can also explicitly specify `trans_node` as `False`. If the defined function input parameter is of type `DocNode`, then you need to specify `transform` as `SentSplitter` and `trans_node` as `True` at the same time when using it. The output parameters of the function can be of type `List[str]` or of type `List[Node]`."
