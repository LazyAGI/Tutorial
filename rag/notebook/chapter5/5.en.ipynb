    "# Chapter 5: Building Custom Reader Components — Easily Parse HTML, PDF, and Other Complex Document Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "> In Part 1 of this tutorial series, we introduced the three key stages of RAG: retrieval, augmentation, and generation. Before these steps, however, we also need document reading and parsing, preprocessing, index construction, and storage optimization. In this chapter, we focus on the document-reading stage and show how to extend it by creating custom Reader components that support additional data formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because RAG retrieves information from a large and diverse document collection, and these documents can come in many formats, a Reader is required to properly process the documents retrieved during the retrieval stage. This ensures that high-quality answers can be generated in the later steps. LazyLLM currently provides built-in Reader support for a variety of formats, including PDF, DOC, HWP, PPT, IPYNB, EPUB, Markdown, MBOX, CSV, Excel, image files, MP3, and MP4. If your required format is not supported—or if the output of the default Reader does not meet your needs—you can implement a custom Reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter describes how to build and use a custom Reader component in LazyLLM. After completing this tutorial, you will understand how to extend LazyLLM with your own Reader and use it to build a simple RAG application.\n",

    "We have already introduced the basic RAG workflow earlier, and in this section we focus on the role and usage of the Reader module. As mentioned before, when a query arrives, it is first processed by the Retriever, which returns relevant text chunks. But this raises an important question: Where do these text chunks come from?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the Reader module comes into play. The Retriever must search for information in a knowledge base, but the content of that knowledge base can take many forms—structured, semi-structured, or completely unstructured. To decouple the retrieval logic from the underlying storage format, we rely on the Reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the Reader is to ingest knowledge stored in various formats and convert it into a unified, retrieval-friendly representation. It ensures that regardless of how the original data is stored, the Retriever receives a consistent format that it can index, search, and process effectively."

    "\n",
    "    - A specific filename\n",

    "    - A file pattern\n",

    "    - A directory pattern\n",

    "    - Or a wildcard path that matches a class of files\n",

    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - \"*.html\" means the Reader can process any file ending with .html.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - \"aaa/bbb/*.html\" means it can process all .html files under the directory aaa/bbb.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - \"aaa/bbb/**/*.html\" means it can process .html files inside all subdirectories of aaa/bbb.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Class-level registration (global)\n",
    "    Registering a Reader on the Document class makes it available to all Document instances.\n",
    "2. Instance-level registration (local)\n",
    "    Registering a Reader on a specific Document instance makes it available only to that single instance. This is the method we demonstrated earlier.\n",

    "2. Reader registered on the Document class\n",
    "3. Default Readers built into LazyLLM\n",
