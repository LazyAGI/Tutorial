    "LazyLLM is a development framework for multi-agent LLM applications. It helps you build complex AI systems with very little effort and iterate on them continuously. The recommended workflow is:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prototype -> Data Analysis -> Iterative Optimization**\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by validating the prototype, analyze bad cases with representative data, and then refine algorithms or fine-tune the models to improve quality. LazyLLM is designed to free researchers and engineers from repetitive engineering so they can focus on algorithms and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The framework offers a consistent experience for different technology stacks within the same module—unified invocation, service, and deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](3_images/img1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For newcomers, LazyLLM dramatically simplifies LLM application development. You don't need to learn how to host different APIs, pick fine-tuning frameworks, split models, or build a web UI. With prebuilt components and lightweight composition you can ship production-grade tools quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For experts, LazyLLM is extremely flexible. Its modular design lets you integrate proprietary algorithms, industry tooling, and the latest research ideas to build powerful applications tailored to any scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial focuses on the core usage patterns. After going through it you will understand the main design concepts and be able to build a role-playing chatbot from scratch.\n",

    "\n",
    "A prompt is the text or instruction provided to an NLP or AI system. It is the primary way users interact with a model. A prompt is not only the user’s input—it often defines the task itself. With well-designed prompts, we can guide a model to produce responses in a specific style or direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompts supply essential contextual information. In a dialogue system, for example, the model generates responses based on predefined system instructions together with user input. Different prompts lead to different outputs, which means prompt design directly affects the quality, accuracy, and relevance of the generated content. When using large models in a question-answering system, we can use prompts to specify the model’s role, tone, and style of response.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "LazyLLM provides prompt templates that you can configure when initializing a model. After defining the prompt, you simply pass user input at inference time. The example below defines two online models: llm1, which uses the default settings, and llm2, which uses a custom prompt."
