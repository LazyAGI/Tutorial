    ">In this chapter, we will introduce how to use RAG to solve statistical problems. First, we will introduce the shortcomings of traditional RAG in processing statistical problems: the inability to directly process structured data and the lack of dynamic computing capabilities. Then we will introduce the basic ideas of RAG to solve statistical problems, as well as the SQL Call and Function Call mechanisms. Next, we will introduce the two respectively. First, we will introduce the related concepts of SQL and how to build a SQL database, and then introduce the specific implementation of Text2SQL technology and sql\\_tool tool. Finally, the basic concept of Function Call is introduced, and how to use the Function Call mechanism to enhance the statistical analysis capabilities of the RAG system.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Advanced 3-Practical Combat, we used the custom parsing PDF Reader and the vector library milvus to build a paper question and answer assistant, extending the capabilities of rag from the plain text field to the multi-modal field. The basic structure of the paper's Q&A assistant is shown in the figure below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](15_images/img7.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we want to know more about these papers, for example, we want to know how many papers there are in a certain paper database, the number of papers published each year, and the growth trend, or more generally, not only for the paper database, assuming that we now have the company's sales, profits and other related data, we want to know \"What are the sales data and growth trends of each month in the past two years?\", \"How has the quarterly profit growth rate changed in the past three years?\", for this type of statistical problem, only the content introduced above is not enough. Can RAG solve these statistical problems? The answer is yes! So let’s take a look at RAG with statistical functions~\n",
    "\n",
    "## The shortcomings of traditional RAG in statistical problems🙋\n",
    "\n",
    "First let us understand \"what is a statistical problem\". Statistical problems are actually various problems related to data. The purpose is to find useful information from the data to help us make decisions or understand certain phenomena. For example, if we now have the test scores of the class, what are the overall test scores of the students in the class? What is the average score? Which subject is the most difficult? Or if there is relevant sales data, what is our sales per month? Have sales of Product A increased? ,\n",
    "\n",
    "After introducing the basic concepts of statistics, let us carefully consider the shortcomings of traditional RAG in statistical problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapters, the RAG we introduced mainly used LLM's natural language understanding and generation capabilities to conduct data-based question and answer. In the Advanced 3 course, although we introduced the processing of tabular data, the tables in statistical questions are much larger than those in PDFs such as papers, and cannot be parsed directly through image data. Moreover, statistical questions usually store massive amounts of data in a structured manner, such as excel, SQL, etc. Structured data statistics problems usually involve specific numbers, tables, databases and other information, requiring precise calculations, reasoning and model construction, while traditional RAG methods mainly rely on retrieving relevant information from large amounts of text data and generating answers through generative models. Specifically, there are the following 2 flaws:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Unable to directly process structured data🤔️\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured data is usually presented in the form of tables, CSV files, databases, etc., while the generation and retrieval module of the RAG model mainly processes natural language text. Although the traditional RAG model can retrieve and generate text-based answers, it does not have the ability to directly parse, understand and operate structured data such as tables and databases. For example, if a statistical problem involves some specific data column operations (such as calculating mean, standard deviation, summary statistics, etc.), the traditional RAG model may not be able to directly extract the required information from the structured data for calculation or reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Lack of dynamic computing capabilities🙁\n",
    "\n",
    "Many structured data statistical problems require real-time calculation and reasoning, such as extracting data through SQL queries and using mathematical formulas for statistical analysis. The traditional RAG model can only generate answers based on the information that has been retrieved, but cannot perform these complex computing tasks during the retrieval process. For example, in multiple regression analysis, traditional RAG may retrieve relevant literature, but it cannot perform regression calculations based on input data and give accurate results. As you can see from the figure below, when we ask a statistical question to ordinary RAG, we will find that it cannot perform dynamic calculations and gives a wrong answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image-2.png](15_images/img1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![image-3.png](15_images/img2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Correct answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image-4.png](15_images/img3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Is there a way to make RAG also have the ability to process structured data and dynamic calculations? Some brothers and sisters! some! This is what we will introduce in this lesson, so that RAG has the ability to solve statistical problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## RAG basic ideas for solving statistical problems ✈️\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Architecture Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to more clearly explain the idea of ​​using the RAG model to solve statistical problems, first we directly give the basic architecture of the RAG model with statistical analysis capabilities, as shown in the figure below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image-5.png](15_images/img4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared with the traditional RAG model, three new key components are added: **Intent recognition module**​, **SQL database**​​** and SQL Call. **\n",
    "\n",
    "* **​Intent Recognition Module:​** Maps user natural language input to predefined intent categories.\n",
    "* **​SQL database:​**Write data into the database to facilitate subsequent searches after the large model generates SQL statements.\n",
    "* ​**SQL Call**​: Map natural language queries directly into executable SQL statements, retrieve data from the database and return it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For ease of understanding here, you can regard Text2SQL and sql\\_tool as the retriever components in the RAG model, and the SQL database as an ordinary database, so that it can be consistent with the structure of the traditional RAG model. That is, relevant information is still retrieved from external data sources. The retrieved data is fed into a large model along with the user's query, ultimately generating detailed answers. In the following, we will introduce the specific principles and implementation of SQL database, Text2SQL and sql\\_tool. Here we first give a few examples to give you an \"​**overall understanding**\" of \"the basic idea of ​​using RAG to solve statistical problems\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Combined with the above architecture diagram, we can abstract the process of statistical analysis problems solved by RAG into the following three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ​**Retrieve relevant data**​: Retrieve relevant data from the database or data source based on the user's question. In this step, we need to call the **Text2SQL** and **sql\\_tool** tools to obtain the SQL statement used for retrieval, and execute it to obtain the retrieval results.\n",
    "2. ​**Calculate related indicators**​: Perform statistical calculations on the retrieved data, such as growth rate, average, sum, etc. In this step, we input the results retrieved in the previous step into the large model, and combined with the query raised by the user, the calculation of the corresponding indicators can be completed.\n",
    "3. ​**Generate Report**​: Generate an analysis report in natural language based on the calculated indicators and related data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Give examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we give two simple examples to facilitate understanding of the three steps mentioned above:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Case 1: Statistical issues of time series data\n",
    "\n",
    "​**Question**​: “What are the sales figures and growth trends for each month of the past two years?”\n",
    "\n",
    "​**Solution process**​:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ​**Retrieve related data**​:\n",
    "    1. Use Text2SQL to convert user questions into SQL query statements, such as retrieving monthly sales data for the past two years.\n",
    "    2. Execute SQL statements through sql\\_tool to extract relevant data from the database.\n",
    "2. ​**Calculate relevant indicators**​:\n",
    "    1. Perform statistical calculations on the retrieved sales data, such as calculating the monthly month-on-month growth rate and year-on-year growth rate, and analyzing the overall trend.\n",
    "3. ​**Generate report**​:\n",
    "    1. Combine calculation results with user queries to generate analysis reports in natural language to describe the trends and growth of sales data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Case 2: Data aggregation and report generation\n",
    "\n",
    "​**Question**​: \"Please give me a summary of the main financial data in last year's annual financial report, including total revenue, net profit, costs, etc.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "​**Solution process**​:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ​**Retrieve related data**​:\n",
    "    1. Use Text2SQL to convert user questions into SQL query statements, such as retrieving financial indicators such as total revenue, net profit, and costs in last year's financial report.\n",
    "    2. Execute SQL statements through sql\\_tool to extract relevant data from the database.\n",
    "2. ​**Calculate relevant indicators**​:\n",
    "    1. Summarize and calculate the retrieved financial data, such as calculating the sum or average of total revenue and net profit.\n",
    "3. ​**Generate report**​:\n",
    "    1. Combine summary results with user queries to generate financial reports in natural language, including data analysis, summary and trend prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core module principles and implementation ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Intent recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "Intent recognition is a key module that maps users' natural language input to predefined intent categories. It is widely used in customer service robots, intelligent voice assistants, conversational search and other scenarios, and can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of human-computer interaction. For example, in the smart customer service scenario, the user input \"I want a refund\" needs to be quickly classified into the \"after-sales application\" intention, triggering the automated work order system; in the voice assistant, \"remind me to have a meeting at 8 o'clock tomorrow morning\" needs to be recognized as the \"schedule management\" intention and the calendar interface is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current mainstream methods include rule-based, traditional machine learning and large-scale pre-training models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Rule-based approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * ​**Keyword matching and regular expressions**​: Pre-defined keywords, phrases and regular expressions are accurately matched to achieve rapid recognition of common intentions. The advantage is that it is easy to understand and deploy, but it does not support diverse expressions and synonym expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Traditional machine learning methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * ​**Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression**​: After vectorizing the text, use SVM, logistic regression and other classifiers for training. You can obtain more stable results through feature engineering (such as TF-IDF, part-of-speech tagging), but it relies heavily on feature design, and expanding new intentions requires a lot of manual adjustments.\n",
    "    * ​**Decision tree, Naive Bayes, etc.**​: Perform well on small-scale data sets, but have difficulty capturing semantic context information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Pre-trained deep model**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * ​**BERT and its variants**​: Using the Transformer model pre-trained on large-scale corpus, it can learn rich contextual representations and significantly improve the recognition accuracy of long-tail intentions and small-sample intentions.\n",
    "    * **Larger large models** (**such as the GPT series**): Through few sample examples or prompting engineering (Prompting) methods, only minimal annotation data is needed to complete the intent classification task, while supporting dynamic expansion of new intent categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image-6.png](15_images/img5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few examples of intent recognition for different scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Customer service scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "​**User input**: ​\"Why hasn't my order been shipped yet?\" **​Recognition intent**: Check order status\n",
    "   \n",
    "​**User input**: ​\"I want to return or exchange goods\" **​Identification intention**: Apply for after-sales service\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Intelligent Assistant Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "​**User input​**: ​\"How will the weather be in Beijing tomorrow?\" **​Recognition intent​**: Query the weather\n",
    "   \n",
    "​**User Input​**: ​\"Set a meeting at 9 am tomorrow\" **​Recognize Intent​**: Create a schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "3. E-commerce scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "​**User input**​: \"Recommendations for Bluetooth headsets within 2,000 yuan\" **​Recognition intent**:​Product recommendations\n",
    "   \n",
    "​**User Input**​: \"How to use the coupon?\" **​Recognize Intent​**: Use the offer\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. Banking/Financial Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "​**User input**​: \"Check my balance\" **​Identification intent**:​Check account balance\n",
    "   \n",
    "​**User input**​: \"Transfer 500 yuan to Zhang San\" **​Identification intent​**: Initiate transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "Although intent recognition technology has been widely used, traditional methods still face obvious limitations in practical scenarios. Rule-based or traditional machine learning methods rely on manual design and are difficult to cope with the diversity of user expressions and rapid changes in new intentions, especially when dealing with long-tail categories and complex semantics. The accuracy is insufficient. In contrast, large models represented by BERT and others rely on their powerful semantic modeling capabilities and context understanding capabilities to significantly improve the accuracy and robustness of intent recognition, and are particularly suitable for business scenarios with few samples and high variability. Therefore, intent recognition based on large models has become the current mainstream solution and is gradually replacing traditional methods and becoming a key trend in industry development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. SQL concepts and database construction🎨\n",
    "#### 2.1 Basic concepts\n",
    "   \n",
    "Before understanding SQL in depth, here is a brief introduction to the overall ecology of the database system. Databases are mainly divided into two categories based on data organization: **relational** and **non-relational**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* ​**Relational databases**​ (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite) manage data in a table structure, support transactions and complex queries, and are suitable for structured data.\n",
    "* **Non-relational data** database is subdivided according to the data model:\n",
    "    * Document type: MongoDB, suitable for flexible storage of semi-structured data;\n",
    "    * Key-value type: Redis, mainly used for high-performance caching;\n",
    "    * Vector databases: FAISS, Milvus, specially designed for high-dimensional vector retrieval, used in recommendation systems, search engines and other scenarios.\n",
    "  \n",
    " ![image-7.png](15_images/img6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our next application is mainly aimed at the relational database, which is based on the relational model and consists of tables, rows, and columns, and uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for data operations and queries. Compared with the convenience of spreadsheet tools such as Excel in processing small and medium-sized data, relational databases show higher performance and consistency guarantee when facing large-scale data. It makes storing, retrieving, updating and managing data efficient and flexible through clear data structure and organization, and can support complex queries and multi-table association operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language specifically designed to manage and operate relational databases. It enables users to perform data query, data insertion, data update, data deletion and other operations in the database through a series of declarative statements, and supports the creation and management of database structures such as tables, views, indexes, etc. The design goal of the SQL language is to simplify database operations so that users do not have to worry about the specific details of data storage and can focus on how to effectively manage and query data. The meaning of the following SQL language is to screen employees whose salary is greater than 5,000 yuan.\n",

    "#### 2.2 Build SQL database\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we start with a simple example to explain how to build a SQL database:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose there is a set of relevant data from the e-commerce platform. After statistics, we get the relevant information of each order.

    "\n",
    "Before introducing SQL Call, we first introduce the core module of SQL Call: Text2SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text2SQL is a natural language processing (NLP) technology designed to convert human natural language queries into SQL query statements. Through this technology, users do not need to learn the syntax or structure of the SQL language. They can directly ask questions in natural language and automatically generate corresponding SQL queries. Text2SQL systems typically rely on deep learning models and natural language processing techniques. Its main workflow is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image-2.png](15_images/img9.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ​**Enter natural language query**​: The user enters a query through text, such as \"List all orders with sales exceeding 1,000.\"\n",
    "2. ​**Language understanding and parsing**​: The system uses natural language understanding technology (such as word embedding, dependency parsing, etc.) to understand user intentions and identify key entities and relationships in the query. For example, it identifies \"sales\" and \"orders\" as the core content of the query.\n",
    "3. ​**SQL generation**​: Based on the results of language understanding, the system automatically generates the corresponding SQL query statement to ensure that the syntax is correct and matches the database structure.\n",
    "4. ​**Output SQL query**​: Finally, the system returns a correct SQL query statement, and the user can directly use this statement to execute it in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, taking the data from the above e-commerce platform as an example, if the input query is \"Please give me the profit summary of each category, sorted from high to low by profit\", we can get the corresponding SQL query statement through Text2SQL:\n",

    "* ​**ChatBI and data platform assistant**​: For example, Tencent Cloud ChatBI automatically converts users' natural language analysis requests into SQL queries through intent recognition and SQL-call, and presents them in the form of charts and reports, which greatly reduces the threshold for BI use.\n",
    "* ​**Intelligent customer service and conversation robot**​: In intelligent customer service, when the user asks questions such as \"query order status\" or \"return progress\", the system queries the relevant information in the database through SQL-call, and converts the results into natural language to reply to the user, such as \"your order has been shipped and is expected to be delivered within three days.\" This not only improves response speed, but also automates business processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SQL-call system contains three core modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Text2SQL: Convert natural language query to SQL statement\n",
    "2. SQL database: stores structured data\n",
    "3. SQL Manager (retrieval): execute SQL and return query results\n",
    "\n",
    "The database types that support SQL calls are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Relational database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL Server, Oracle\n",
    "* Distributed database: CockroachDB, TiDB, etc.\n",
    "  \n",
    "With the intent recognition module and SQL Call module, we already have the core capabilities to support SQL-related Q&A based on the traditional RAG framework. The specific system construction process will be explained in detail in subsequent practical courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Add SQL Call to RAG**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can introduce the statistical question-answering capabilities of SQL into RAG. The specific process is that the user inputs the query, and through the intent recognition module, it is decided whether to call SQL Call or just use traditional RAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image-3.png](15_images/img12.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "🔍 For SQL branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convert the query into the corresponding SQL query statement according to the user's request\n",
    "2. Call the SQL statement to get the query results\n",

    "### 1. ChatBI 📊\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is ChatBI?\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatBI (Chat-based Business Intelligence) is an intelligent system that combines natural language processing (NLP), large language model (LLM) and data analysis capabilities. It allows users to talk to data through natural language and complete tasks such as data query, report generation, analysis and insight, just like chatting with people. Take DataFocus BI as an example. It features \"retrieval BI\", provides rich chart styles and a simple interactive interface, and supports the concepts of SQL freedom and data equality.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image-5.png](15_images/img14.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ChatBI architecture design diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the concept of ChatBI, we designed a RAG system that integrates SQL query and chart drawing capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image-6.png](15_images/img15.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall process is: after the user raises a question and passes the intent recognition, the system first uses the Text2SQL tool to convert the natural language into the corresponding SQL statement and executes the query; then the query results are handed over to the large language model (LLM) for processing, and a drawing function is registered for it, so that the model can call the drawing tool based on the data results and automatically generate the corresponding chart. In this way, the system can achieve integrated output of data analysis and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Function Call 🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic concepts of Function Call\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we used SQL Call technology (that is, three steps of building a database, Text2SQL and SQL query) to successfully equip RAG with the statistical ability to process structured data, solving the first flaw of traditional RAG in statistical problems. Is there any way we can solve the problem of RAG's lack of dynamic computing capabilities? At the same time, although the above SQL query can perform some simple mathematical operations and logical operations, in practice you may face very complex mathematical calculations and even modeling problems, which cannot be directly executed through SQL. To address these difficulties, we can introduce the Function Call mechanism to give the system high-level statistical analysis capabilities. Next, we will first introduce the basic concept and use of Function Call, and then introduce how to use the Function Call mechanism in RAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you ask any large model \"What's the current weather in Beijing?\", it will generally return some random answers, because their training data has an expiration date, and this latest information is invisible to them. In response to this situation, Function Call came into being. Function Call refers to executing a defined function in programming in order to run the code logic contained in the function. In the above example, we can define a weather API. When the user asks, calling the weather API can get the latest weather information to answer the user's question and improve the user experience. In fact, the sql\\_tool mentioned above is also an external function call based on Function Call.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image-7.png](15_images/img16.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The principle of Function Call is the same as the principle of using functions in programming. We tell the large model that there are several functions that can be called, which capabilities each function corresponds to, and what the input and output parameters are. In this way, the large model can provide a parameter list for the function call according to the needs. Of course, function calling and input and output parameter parsing need to be implemented through traditional programming. At this time, using a framework can help you save the development of this part of the code. Function Call can be implemented by directly inputting the available methods. Let's briefly talk about an example to give you an in-depth understanding of Function Call. We also take the weather query case as an example. There is now such a weather query API, which receives the location as a parameter and returns the weather conditions of the corresponding location, which is expressed in the form of JSON as:"
