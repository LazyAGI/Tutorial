However, when there are a large number of papers, for some statistical information, such as the number of papers in a certain direction, the number of papers in a certain conference, etc., it is impossible to retrieve this information only through traditional RAG. In this regard, this chapter will briefly review the previous content, and then upgrade it to complete an intelligent question and answer system that integrates statistical analysis and knowledge question and answer functions."

DeepSeek-R1-Zero is trained using large-scale reinforcement learning without supervised fine-tuning and demonstrates strong reasoning capabilities but faces challenges such as poor readability and language mixing. To improve upon this, DeepSeek-R1 incorporates multi-stage training and cold-start data before reinforcement learning, achieving performance comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217 on reasoning tasks. The research community is supported by the open-sourcing of DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Qwen and Llama.\"\n",
