When a user submits a query, the system searches the vector index, retrieves relevant text chunks, and passes them to the LLM as context for answer generation. The retrieved content is usually isolated text blocks without structural links. When a task requires reasoning across documents or paragraphs, the retrieved chunks often lack logical or semantic coherence, which leads to inaccurate or incomplete responses. Naive RAG also lacks structural awareness, making it hard to detect relationships between documents. Combined with noisy or missing retrieval results, critical information may be omitted or repeated. These limitations severely affect performance on complex question answering, logical reasoning, and multi-hop retrieval tasks.\n"

It explicitly models semantic associations through entity–relation–attribute triples so the system can clearly capture the semantic paths between pieces of knowledge. With structure-aware retrieval or path traversal on the graph, the system can recall information that is semantically relevant and logically coherent with the user’s query, which significantly improves accuracy and interpretability. Knowledge graphs also align entities across documents, reinforce thematic clustering, and support complex reasoning, making them ideal for multi-hop QA and high-level logical reasoning tasks.\n"

    "Lanterns blazed while incense curled upward. Song Jiang stood at the center to swear his oath, mourning beneath Yongjin Gate while Dai Zong remained at his side. A monk first rang his bell and chanted, summoning Zhang Shun's soul and inviting it to descend upon the spirit banner; afterward Dai Zong read the funeral oration aloud. Song Jiang poured the wine libation with his own hands, lifted his face toward the eastern capital, and cried bitterly. In mid-wail, shouts erupted beneath the bridge and drums thundered from both the southern and northern hills as two detachments charged in to seize Song Jiang. Truly: \"Kindness repaid can turn West Lake into a battlefield for loyal retainers.\" Truly: \"Strike down several southern generals and churn West Lake into waves a myriad fathoms high.\" How Song Jiang and Dai Zong met the enemy must wait for the next chapter. In this encounter three officers fell—Hao Siwen, Xu Ning, and Zhang Shun—while the court sent back one man to their ranks: An Daoquan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 155 — Zhejiang's Qiantang West Lake is indeed a place of natural splendor, with luminous mountains and crystal-clear water. It is worthy of an imperial capital, famed for its prosperity since ancient times. Just as Song Jiang and Dai Zong were burning paper offerings for Zhang Shun on Xiling Bridge, Fang Tianding learned of it and dispatched ten lieutenants in two columns to capture Song Jiang. The southern ridge was manned by Wu Zhi, Zhao Yi, Chao Zhong, Yuan Xing, and Su Jing; the northern ridge by Wen Kerang, Cui Yu, Lian Ming, Mao Di, and Tang Fengshi. Each route fielded five officers with three thousand troops. Near midnight both gates opened and the soldiers poured out from north and south. Song Jiang and Dai Zong had only begun their libations when a roar burst forth beneath the bridge. Fan Rui and Ma Lin hid with five thousand men on the left, Shi Xiu with another five thousand on the right. Seeing flames ahead, every ambush raised its own signal fires. The troops split and struck the enemy forces on both hills. Realizing they had been anticipated, the southern troops hurried back but were chased on both flanks. When Wen Kerang withdrew with four generals to recross the river, he collided with Ruan Xiao'er, Ruan Xiaowu, and Meng Kang leading five thousand men down from Mount Baoshuta; they severed the retreat, captured Mao Di alive, and speared Tang Fengshi to death. Wu Zhi on the southern ridge likewise turned back, only to slam into Li Kui, Bao Xu, Xiang Chong, and Li Gun at Dingxiang Bridge with five hundred infantry. The two shield bearers charged headlong, whirling their rattan shields while their flying knives flashed, cutting down Yuan Xing on the spot. Bao Xu hacked apart Su Jing, Li Kui split Zhao Yi with his axe, and the victors returned to the command tent. \"By arranging my stratagem this way,\" Song Jiang told the strategist, \"we already have the heads of four of their officers and Mao Di alive. We will deliver him to Commander Zhang for execution.\" Yet he still had no news from Dongsong Pass or Deqing, so he sent Dai Zong to scout and urge a report. Several days later Dai Zong returned, bowed to the vanguard, and said, \"Lu the Vanguard has already crossed Dongsong Pass and will arrive soon.\" Song Jiang, half anxious and half relieved, asked, \"How did the army fare?\" Dai Zong replied, \"I know every detail of the fighting and I have the official dispatch. Marshal, please set your mind at ease.\" \"Surely I have not lost more brothers?\" Song Jiang pressed. \"Speak honestly.\" Dai Zong answered, \"When Lu the Vanguard marched to seize Dongsong Pass, mountains towered on both sides with only a single road between them and the fort atop the ridge. A lofty tree beside the pass, dozens of spans tall, could observe every approach, and the slopes were thick with pines. Three rebel generals guarded the gate: Wu Sheng in command, with Jiang Yin second and Wei Heng third. At first Lin Chong fought them daily at the foot of the pass and wounded Jiang Yin with his serpent spear. Wu Sheng dared not descend and stayed on the walls. Later Li Tianrun led four officers—Li Tianyou, Zhang Jian, Zhang Tao, and Yao Yi—to reinforce the pass. The next day the battle flared again. Among the rebels Li Tianyou rode out first to duel Lu Fang; after fifty or sixty bouts Lu Fang killed him with a single thrust. The enemy retreated behind the gate and refused to come down. Lu the Vanguard waited several days below the pass. Seeing how treacherous the mountains were, he sent Ou Peng, Deng Fei, Li Zhong, and Zhou Tong up to scout. He never expected Li Tianrun to charge down seeking revenge for his brother, leading the rebels in a sudden assault. His very first stroke beheaded Zhou Tong, and Li Zhong fled wounded. Had reinforcements arrived any later, all would have been lost—but the remaining three officers were rescued in time.\"\n",

On Liangshan Marsh he ranked alongside Song Jiang and often served as vanguard. He once held off four foreign generals single-handedly and beheaded Yelü Zonglin, and he took part in numerous expeditions against cities such as Jizhou and Tanzhou. After being appointed Deputy Vanguard, Lu Junyi led armies to attack Xuanzhou, Huzhou, and other key targets while carrying out Song Jiang's orders. During the pacification campaigns, he displayed both bravery and exceptional command skill. As Song Jiang's chief lieutenant, he commanded the central army, discussed strategy with the other heroes, and personally led charges to smash enemy lines. Beyond combat, he helped Song Jiang negotiate the imperial amnesty and fought back Liao incursions. He led troops across Yuling Pass, stormed Shezhou, and demonstrated his leadership even when setbacks struck. Though he endured defeats in several campaigns, he remained one of Liangshan's principal commanders, sharing the burden of directing the army and ultimately helping Liangshan submit to the court. Lu Junyi was ennobled, served as Deputy Commander of the imperial forces and as Deputy Vanguard of the pacification campaign, took part in multiple expeditions, and eventually died after falling into the Huai River, adding another tragic turn to the story.</data>\n",

    "The goal of knowledge-graph retrieval is to return the entities, relations, or paths that match a user query so the answer can be precise. Because queries are usually textual, we first parse the query and extract the relevant entities and relations. For example, when the user asks “What did Newton discover?”, we detect the entity “Newton” and the relation “discovered,” then look for the corresponding relation in the graph. In practice, the query is translated into a set of paths or subgraph matches. The system searches for nodes and edges that match the entities and relations in the query to obtain the related subgraph. For more complex queries we may need to perform path search, starting from one entity and walking along relation edges to find additional entities. For instance, to answer “What is the relationship between Einstein and Newton?”, the system starts from “Einstein” and “Newton” and traverses relations such as “influenced” or “inherited” to find their connection. The process is illustrated in Figure 3.\n"

    "Specifically, LightRAG extracts entities and relations from documents, deduplicates them, and then builds the graph index. The resulting knowledge graph (center of Figure 6) stores each node as an entity name, type, description, and original chunk ID, while each relation records the source, target, keywords, description, and originating chunk IDs. When a query arrives, the LLM extracts keywords at two levels: specific keywords that focus on concrete entities (names, types, etc.) and abstract keywords that capture higher-level topics or domains. The graph is searched with the specific keywords to perform low-level retrieval of related entities and concepts, and with the abstract keywords to perform high-level retrieval of broader themes or trends. The LLM then receives the relevant entities, relations, and source passages as context to answer the question. When new data is added, only the new nodes and edges need to be inserted without rebuilding the entire index, which greatly reduces computation.\n"

For example, the entity “Lin Chong” is linked to more than 140 chunks. After entity retrieval there is no way to re-rank those chunks, so the `MAX_TOKEN` limit may keep less relevant chunks while truncating truly relevant ones.\n"

They focus on his early heroic deeds, the incident where he killed the butcher in the restaurant, his escape, and later adventures. None of these cover how he dies. In the full story of *Water Margin*, Lu Zhishen passes away after the Fang La campaign. He hears the tides at Qiantang, realizes his time has come, bathes, puts on clean robes, writes a gatha, and peacefully enters nirvana at Liuhe Temple—details that were not present in the retrieved chunks. |\n",

He completes the transition from warrior to monk and leaves the mortal world voluntarily rather than dying in battle. The summary explains that he fought bravely, followed a path of spiritual awakening, and ultimately sat in meditation until he passed away. |\n",

    "Another punch crashed into Zheng the Butcher's temple, as if an entire Buddhist ceremony erupted at once with bells, cymbals, and gongs. When Lu Da looked down he saw Zheng sprawled on the ground, breathing out but no longer breathing in. The prefectural constable feigned, \"So you want to play dead? I'll hit you again,\" and Zheng's face began to change color. Lu Da thought, \"I only meant to thrash him, yet three punches actually killed him. I'll be hauled into court and no one will bring me meals in jail. I'd better slip away.\" He strode off at once, pointing back at the corpse: \"Keep pretending, I'll deal with you slowly.\" Still cursing, he marched away with great strides. None of the neighbors or Zheng's servants dared block him. Once back at his quarters, Lu Da hastily gathered his fine clothes and silver, abandoned the old rags, grabbed a staff as tall as his brow, and bolted out the south gate like a puff of smoke.\n",
    "\n",
    "At Zheng's house everyone tried to revive him for half a day but he died. The neighbors filed a complaint with the prefect. The upright prefect ascended the hall, read the petition, and said, \"Lu Da is a constable from the Imperial Guard; I dare not seize him without reporting it.\" He rode to the Guard Command, dismounted, and sent the gate soldiers to announce him. When he was escorted inside and the formalities were done, the commandant asked, \"What brings you here?\" The prefect replied, \"Constable Lu Da has beaten the market butcher Zheng to death without cause. I dare not arrest him without informing you.\" The commandant was startled. \"Lu Da may be skilled, but his temper is coarse. Since he has caused a death, he must be questioned.\" He told the prefect, \"Lu Da once served my late father. Because I lacked able men I transferred him here as a constable. Since he has committed murder, arrest him and interrogate him according to the law. Once the confession is secured and the sentence decided, notify my father as well; if he needs this man later at the frontier, it would look bad.\" \"I will investigate,\" the prefect answered, \"and report the matter to your noble father before sentencing.\" He took his leave, returned to the prefecture, sat in the hall, and immediately ordered the constables to draw up the warrants for Lu Da's arrest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Warden Wang received the writ, gathered more than twenty officers, and marched straight to Lu Da's lodgings. The landlord said, \"He just left carrying some bundles and a short staff. I thought he had official business, so I dared not ask.\" Hearing this, Warden Wang opened the room and found only old clothes and bedding. He took the landlord to search in every direction, from south of the city to the north, but Lu Da was nowhere to be found. He arrested two neighbors along with the landlord and reported back, \"Lu Da fled in fear of punishment. We do not know where he went, but we have the landlord and his neighbors.\" The prefect jailed them and summoned Zheng's neighbors for questioning, ordering the coroner to prepare.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile Lu Da saw a crowd jammed around a notice at the crossroads and joined them. Unable to read, he listened while the others recited: \"By order of the Taoyuan Command, pursuant to the Weizhou writ, seize Lu Da, the constable of the Imperial Guard, for killing the butcher Zheng. Anyone who shelters him will share his crime; anyone who captures him or informs on him will receive a bounty of one thousand strings of cash.\" Just then someone shouted behind him, \"Brother Zhang, why are you here?\" and seized him around the waist, pulling him away from the crossroads. If that person had not acted in time, Lu Da would soon have been shaven, stripped of his beard, forced to change his name, and driven mad like a raging arhat. Only such force could \"clear the perilous road with a monk's staff and strike down injustice with a precept blade.\" Who grabbed Lu Da? That will be revealed in the next installment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elsewhere, a woman wiped her tears, bowed deeply three times, and the old man beside her did the same. Lu Da asked, \"Where are you from, and why are you crying?\" The woman replied, \"Sir, please allow me to explain. I am from the Eastern Capital. I traveled here to Weizhou with my parents to seek relatives, but they moved to Nanjing. My mother died of illness in the inn, leaving only my father and me to suffer in this strange place. A rich man here named Zheng, called Zheng the Guardian of the Pass, saw me and hired a broker to force me to become his concubine. He wrote a contract for three thousand strings—money in name only—to take control of my body. Before three months passed, his fierce wife beat me and drove me out, forbidding us to live together. The innkeeper was ordered to collect the original three thousand strings. My father is timid, he cannot argue with them, and Zheng is powerful. We never received a single coin from him, so how could we repay it now? With no choice, my father taught me a few songs when I was young, so I came to this wine shop to perform for tips. Whatever I earn each day, I hand over most of it and keep only a little for our meals. Business has been slow these past two days, so I'm behind on payment and fear his insults when he comes to collect. Thinking of all our hardships with nowhere to turn, we wept. We did not mean to offend you—please forgive us.\" Lu Da asked, \"What is your name? Where are you lodging? Where does this Zheng live?\" The old man replied, \"My surname is Jin; this is my daughter Cuilian. Zheng lives under Scholar's Bridge selling pork; they call him Zheng the Guardian. We are staying at the Lu family inn inside the east gate.\" Lu Da snorted, \"So the great 'Master' Zheng is merely a pig butcher! That scoundrel clings to my commander's banner as a provisioner and dares bully honest folk. You two stay here—I'll go kill him and be right back.\" Li Zhong and Shi Jin grabbed him and urged, \"Brother, calm down. We'll deal with it tomorrow.\" After much persuading he relented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lu Da said, \"Old man, come here! I'll give you some traveling money so you can return to the Eastern Capital.\" The father and daughter cried, \"If we could go home, it would be as though we were born anew—to have parents twice over! But the innkeeper won't let us leave; Master Zheng ordered him to collect the money.\" Lu Da replied, \"That's no problem. I have a way.\" \n",

    "-----Document Chunks(DC)-----```json[{\"id\": \"1\", \"content\": \"Lu Da stepped in close, braced his foot on Zheng the Butcher's chest, and raised a fist as big as a vinegar bowl. He barked, 'I joined Commandant Zhang and earned the title of Guardian of Five Routes in the northwest—that name suits me. You're just a knife-wielding pork butcher, no better than a cur, yet you dare to call yourself Guardian of the Pass? How dare you coerce Jin Cuilian?' With one punch he smashed Zheng's nose, sending blood spurting and twisting it to one side until it looked like a leaking pickle jar with salty, sour, and spicy brine pouring out. Zheng collapsed and dropped his dagger, whimpering, 'Good hit!' Lu Da cursed, 'You wretch, still talking back?' Another blow split the skin beside the eye, squeezed out the eyeball like a bolt of cloth, streaked red, black, and purple. The onlookers feared Lu Da and did not dare intervene.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zheng begged for mercy. Lu Da shouted, 'Bah! You're a ruined lout. If you had the spine to fight to the end I might spare you, but the moment you plead, I refuse.' He drove another punch into Zheng's temple, as if bells, cymbals, and gongs all rang at once. Zheng lay motionless, breathing out but not in. 'Playing dead, are you? I'll hit you again.' Zheng's face began to change color.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lu Da thought, 'I only meant to beat him soundly, yet three punches have truly killed him. I'll have to face trial and no one will bring me meals. I'd better leave now.' He strode off, pointed at the corpse, and said, 'Keep pretending and I'll settle the score later.' Still cursing, he marched away while Zheng's household and the neighbors did not dare stop him. Back at his lodging he hastily packed clothing and silver, discarded the heavy old garments, grabbed a brow-high staff, and shot out the south gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zheng's family tried in vain to revive him and reported the death to the prefect. The prefect read the complaint and said, 'Lu Da is a constable of the Imperial Guard; I cannot arrest him without approval.' He rode to the Guard Command, paid his respects, and reported, 'Constable Lu Da has beaten the market butcher Zheng to death.' The commandant was shocked. 'Lu Da may be brave but his temper is coarse. Since he has caused a death, question him at once.' He explained that Lu Da once served his late father, but now the law had to run its course, though the elder commandant should be informed before sentencing. The prefect agreed, returned to his office, and issued warrants for Lu Da's arrest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Warden Wang led more than twenty officers to Lu Da's quarters. The landlord said, 'He just left with some bundles and a staff. I assumed he was on duty.' They opened the room and found only old clothes and bedding. Warden Wang took the landlord to search the whole city but could not find Lu Da, so he arrested the landlord and two neighbors and presented them at the prefecture. The prefect jailed them, summoned Zheng's neighbors, and ordered the coroner to prepare.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, Lu Da spotted people crowding around a notice at the crossroads. He could not read, so he listened as others recited: 'By order of the Taoyuan Command and the Weizhou writ, seize Constable Lu Da for beating Zheng the Butcher to death. Anyone who shelters him shares his guilt; anyone who captures or reports him will receive one thousand strings of cash.' As he listened, someone shouted, 'Brother Zhang, why are you here?' grabbed him around the waist, and dragged him away. Had that person not seen him, Lu Da would soon have been shaved, stripped of his beard, forced to change his name, and hounded like a wrathful arhat, until only a monk's staff could open the dangerous road and a precept blade strike down injustice.\n",
    "\n",
    "A woman, wiping her tears, bowed three times, and the old man with her did the same. 'Where are you from and why are you crying?' Lu Da asked. 'Sir, let me explain,' the woman replied. 'We are from the Eastern Capital. My parents and I traveled to Weizhou to seek relatives, but they moved to Nanjing. My mother died of illness at the inn, leaving only my father and me to suffer here. A wealthy man named Zheng the Guardian saw me and forced a broker to make me his concubine. He wrote a contract for three thousand strings—money only on paper—to take me away. Before three months passed, his harsh wife beat me out of the house. The innkeeper now demands the full three thousand strings. My father is meek and cannot argue, and Zheng wields great power. We never received a single coin, so how can we repay it? My father taught me a few tunes when I was young, so I now sing at this tavern. Whatever I earn each day, I hand most of it over and keep a little for us to live on. Business has been slow these days, so I'm behind on the payments and fear his humiliation when he comes to collect. Thinking of our misery, we had no one else to tell, so we cried. Please forgive the offense.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'What's your surname? Where do you stay? Where does this Zheng live?' Lu Da asked. 'My surname is Jin and this is my daughter Cuilian,' the old man answered. 'Zheng lives under Scholar's Bridge selling pork; they call him the Guardian of the Pass. We lodge at the Lu family inn inside the east gate.' 'Bah!' Lu Da exclaimed. 'So the so-called master is just a pig butcher! He clings to my commander's banner as a provisioner and yet bullies the innocent. You two stay here; I'll go kill him and return.' Li Zhong and Shi Jin grabbed him, urging him to wait until morning. After repeated persuasion he calmed down.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lu Da then said, 'Old man, come here. I'll give you travel money so you can return to the capital.' 'If we could go home, it would be as though we had been reborn,' the father and daughter cried. 'But the innkeeper won't let us leave, because Zheng ordered him to collect the money.' 'That's no problem,' Lu Da replied. 'I have my own plan.'\", \"file_path\": \"unknown_source\"}]\n",
