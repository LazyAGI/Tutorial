    "# Chapter 17: a full-link solution for permissions, sharing and content security\n",
    "\n",
    ">In the previous tutorial, we mainly discussed the implementation and optimization techniques of personal-level RAG (Retrieval Augmentation Generation) applications. However, in enterprise-level applications, the requirements for knowledge management and intelligent retrieval are more complex, involving multiple departments, each with independent business fields, data storage methods, and algorithm requirements. Therefore, efficiently managing and retrieving knowledge, ensuring flexible access to knowledge bases by different departments, while meeting data isolation, security and sharing mechanisms are the core challenges of enterprise-level knowledge management systems. This chapter will introduce how to use LazyLLM to quickly build enterprise-level database management and retrieval and recall services to meet the above complex requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Diversified needs of enterprise-level knowledge bases\n",
    "\n",
    "In actual enterprise applications, knowledge bases are no longer a simple stack of information, but need to face complex demands from multiple dimensions such as permissions, sharing methods, and security guarantees. Below we start from typical scenarios to systematically elaborate on these diverse needs and their response strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Scenario 1: Knowledge access isolated by department (diversity of permission management)**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Customer background: large manufacturing enterprise**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The enterprise has multiple functional departments (such as R&D, procurement, and sales), each of which is responsible for information collection and management in different fields. The document content covers supply chain cooperation, cost accounting, product planning, etc. The information is highly sensitive and internal access must be strictly isolated.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - Department-specific knowledge base: Each business unit can independently maintain professional content such as product documents, market analysis, financial reports, etc., and the system automatically isolates unauthorized access.\n",
    "> - Smart label system: Supports professional label systems such as \"R&D - Technical White Paper\" and \"Market - Competitive Product Analysis\" to achieve accurate retrieval and controlled sharing.\n",
    "> - Management Cockpit: Senior management can obtain cross-department knowledge summaries through the \"Strategic View\" tab to ensure decision support while maintaining data security.\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Scenario 2: Collaboration needs of multiple sharing methods (diversity of sharing methods)**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Customer background: Consulting service company**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The company often conducts joint projects with different customers, involving document sharing, stage reports, project materials and algorithm resources, etc. Customers use diverse tools and preferences and require flexible sharing mechanisms to balance business cooperation and document confidentiality.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - Algorithm resource sharing: Supports the sharing and reuse of core components such as llm models, embedding models, and retrieval algorithms within the enterprise.\n",
    "> - Knowledge reuse for differentiated calls: A project knowledge base can serve internal consultants, customer technical teams and third-party analysis agencies at the same time. Different recall rules can be configured to achieve recall decoupling and satisfy multiple roles for accurate access.\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Scenario 3: Multiple security strategies to ensure content security (security assurance diversity)**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Customer background: Fintech company**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The knowledge base contains a large amount of sensitive content, such as user financial behavior analysis, regulatory compliance plans, audit materials, etc., which places extremely high requirements on information security.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Security Requirements:**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - Intelligent filtering of sensitive words: Built-in multi-level sensitive word identification strategy, dynamic judgment based on context, automatic prompts, replacement or blocking of output during the question and answer and retrieval process, preventing the leakage of information such as internal blacklists, customer confidentiality, confidential terms, etc.\n",
    "> - Full-link knowledge encryption: Symmetric or asymmetric encryption mechanisms can be enabled in the uploading, parsing, warehousing, transmission and generation stages of knowledge documents to ensure that knowledge is not stolen or tampered throughout the entire life cycle.\n",
    "> - Privatized deployment solution: The platform can be fully deployed on a private server within the enterprise network or a dedicated cloud environment, including knowledge base, vector engine, retrieval module and model inference service, ensuring that knowledge data is not transmitted through the public network. The system can seamlessly integrate enterprise authentication, permissions and log systems to form a closed-loop security protection structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enterprise-level application scenarios put forward more dimensional requirements for knowledge bases. LazyLLM provides solutions for these needs in three aspects: permission management, sharing mode and security assurance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Permission diversity and solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Permission isolation: Support independent knowledge operations of multiple departments\n",
    "\n",
    "In large enterprises, each department usually has an independent document system, and these documents may contain sensitive business information, internal operation manuals or key process documents. In order to ensure information security and usage compliance, enterprises have put forward higher requirements for document management capabilities and isolation mechanisms. Common management challenges include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to support high-frequency updates and maintenance of knowledge base?\n",
    "- If the same document is used by multiple departments, does it need to be stored in the database multiple times? Leading to data redundancy and management difficulties?\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](17_images/img2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, lazyllm has a built-in flexible document management service and provides a complete set of functions for adding, deleting, modifying, and checking documents. Users can easily add new documents, modify existing content, delete expired documents, and perform searches when needed to ensure that the knowledge base is always up to date. Different knowledge bases are isolated from each other, which can help enterprises flexibly divide knowledge base access boundaries according to departments, positions, projects and other dimensions, and realize a controllable strategy of \"who can see, what can be seen, and how much can be seen.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, within the same knowledge base storage, the document management group function is supported for group management, and the same document only needs to be parsed once.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image-2.png](17_images/img1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Document Management Services\n",
    "\n",
    "Enabling the document management service is very simple. You only need to set the `manager` parameter to `ui` when creating the `document` object to enable the document management function.

    "### 2. Permission diversity: supports more fine-grained access control\n",
    "\n",
    "In the actual operation of an enterprise, permission requirements are far more than simply \"which department accesses which document\". Members of different groups, positions, and even projects often need to share some knowledge while protecting sensitive content from being misread or leaked. In order to meet this complex and changing demand, LazyLLM provides permission control capabilities based on tag retrieval. Enterprises can label documents with multiple labels such as department, position, time, file type, etc., and configure corresponding access rights for different roles to achieve refined management. For example, the marketing department may want to retrieve documents related to \"product promotion\", while the R&D department may be more interested in documents in the \"technical specifications\" category. In addition to tag-based filtering requirements, users also want to be able to specify a specific set of documents to query during retrieval, rather than searching the entire knowledge base. For example, a legal department may only want to retrieve contract documents from the most recent year, rather than all historical contracts. Therefore, the system needs to support precise queries for part of the document collection in the knowledge base to improve the accuracy and efficiency of search.\n",

    "\n",
    "**LazyLLM Solution** **————Tag-based permission control mechanism**:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Each document can be bound to predefined tags (such as department, project, security level) when uploading\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Support tag-based filtering during retrieval, and only return content that meets the conditions\n",

    "- Define label field: department\n",
    "- Specify when uploading documents: department = Legal Affairs Department\n",
    "- Automatically inject filter conditions during retrieval: filter={\"department\": \"Legal Affairs Department\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this mechanism, **role-based isolated access** is achieved, which not only ensures data security, but also simplifies the implementation of permission policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](17_images/img6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In practical applications, the authentication logic should be managed uniformly by the backend, and the algorithm side should not directly handle authentication. This ensures the centralization and security of permission control and avoids security vulnerabilities caused by bypassing permissions on the algorithm side.\n",

    "### 2. Recall decoupling: Support flexible collaboration between knowledge base and recall service\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to cope with complex knowledge sharing and reuse requirements, enterprises increasingly need flexible and efficient knowledge organization structures and management capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requires many-to-many knowledge organization structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enterprises often hope to centrally manage multiple knowledge bases through a unified document management service, which not only supports the independent maintenance of knowledge content by each business department, but also ensures controlled sharing when needed.\n",
    "- The same knowledge base can also be called by multiple RAG recall systems, realizing knowledge reuse across business systems and improving the coverage and intelligent capabilities of model services.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requires knowledge reuse capabilities in multiple business scenarios**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Facing diversified business needs such as customer service, compliance, risk control, and market, companies must ensure that knowledge can be efficiently reused, and at the same time, it can be independently updated and adapted flexibly according to scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to meet the above needs, LazyLLM not only provides a flexible document management module, but also completely decouples document management and RAG recall services to meet the diversity of enterprise knowledge management and recall needs. The benefits of this are specifically reflected in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Many-to-many management mode**: One document management service can manage **multiple knowledge bases** at the same time, supporting the knowledge storage needs of different business departments.\n",
    "- **Multiple RAG Adaptation**: The same **Knowledge Base** can be applied to **Multiple RAG Recall Services**, and one RAG Recall Service can retrieve data from multiple **Knowledge Bases**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to this decoupling design, it is ensured that enterprises can dynamically adjust the binding relationship between the knowledge base and the RAG recall service in different business scenarios to meet personalized knowledge management needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](17_images/img11.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In specific implementation, only the following two steps are needed to build a multi-knowledge base management and recall process.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.**Initialize knowledge base**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to initialize the knowledge base:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Path definition method**: If you already have organized knowledge base documents, you can directly define the knowledge base by specifying the file path.\n",
    "- **Dynamic management method**: If the knowledge base needs to be dynamically adjusted, you can upload, delete and manage it by starting the knowledge base service.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: The method of uploading documents by starting the service can only bind one path. If there are multiple databases with different paths, it is recommended to use the path definition method; flexibly register different algorithms for different knowledge bases, but the name of the node group needs to be kept consistent for subsequent joint recall.\n",

    "## 4. Dialogue management and solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "In the actual business of enterprises, the dialogue system needs to be able to remember the user's previous chat content and better understand the user's current needs based on historical dialogue. For example, the customer service robot needs to know what questions the user has asked before to avoid repeated answers; or the AI ​​assistant can combine previous chat content to optimize the current question and make the answer more accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, the system must support simultaneous use by multiple users to ensure that conversations between different users do not interfere with each other. For example, user A is chatting with the robot about order issues, and user B is consulting product information. The system must be able to distinguish their conversation records without confusion. In addition, real-time streaming output must be supported, allowing users to see replies step by step like a normal chat, instead of waiting for all to be generated before displaying.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to realize these functions, lazyllm provides a unified configuration center `globals`, which manages the conversation history, contextual information, etc. of different users, and automatically cleans up unnecessary data after the conversation ends to avoid wasting resources. Through `globals`, the system can isolate the conversation history and context of different sessions to avoid data interference, and at the same time, centrally save user conversation parameters, incoming file paths, and intermediate results generated during the conversation for subsequent processing. This design ensures data consistency and efficient flow between services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will introduce how to implement historical conversation management and multi-user concurrent conversation management through `globals`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Historical dialogue management\n",
    "\n",
    "​ First, we combine the `globals` configuration center to implement a dialogue process that supports historical context and streaming output.    `lazyllm.OnlineChatModule(stream=True)` initializes a large language model that supports streaming output, and uses `ThreadPoolExecutor` to establish a thread pool to support up to 50 concurrent requests. Each request is allocated a free position in `slots` to ensure that the set maximum number of connections is not exceeded at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each time a new session is started, `init_session_config` will combine the default few-shot prompts and user-defined historical conversations, and uniformly initialize them into the `globals` space under the corresponding `session_id` to ensure that each session has an independent context.\n",
    "- In order to safely manage the model inference process in a multi-threaded environment, the `respond_stream` method uses `contextvars` to copy the current context when submitting inference tasks to avoid concatenation of context variables between different sessions. During the entire response process, the streaming effect of generating and outputting is achieved through `FileSystemQueue`, and after the inference is completed, the latest user input and assistant reply are appended to the session history.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to conveniently manage the session life cycle, the system provides the `with_session` decorator to automatically complete context switching, and the `handle_request` function serves as a unified entrance and can initiate a new streaming conversation based on the incoming `session_id` and historical records. This mechanism not only realizes multi-user isolation and historical memory management, but also ensures stability and consistency in high concurrency scenarios, providing basic support for subsequent access to more complex interactions.\n",

    "\n",
    "​ Also based on the above design, the following code further improves the **multi-user session management and historical conversation tracking** mechanism based on `globals`. The system initializes a streaming reasoning module `lazyllm.OnlineChatModule(stream=True)`, and supports up to 50 concurrent requests through `ThreadPoolExecutor`. At the same time, it manages connection resources through the `slots` array to ensure that different user sessions do not interfere with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Whenever a new request arrives, the `init_session_config` method initializes the context environment under the corresponding `session_id` based on the incoming user history. If there is no history, a blank conversation history is assigned by default to ensure that each session track is independent. To simplify context switching for multiple session calls, the `with_session` decorator automatically binds the correct `session_id` before executing the function.\n",
    "- During actual reasoning, the `SessionResponder` class is responsible for initiating streaming conversations, and uses `contextvars` internally to capture the current context, ensuring that correct session isolation can be maintained even when inference tasks are performed in the thread pool. The system implements streaming output through `FileSystemQueue`, and returns the generated content in real time during the reasoning process. After the reasoning is completed, the current round of dialogue is completely appended to the history record for subsequent continuous dialogue use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, an external example shows how to use the `handle_request` function to initiate multiple rounds of dialogue.

    "## 6. Overall implementation idea of ​​enterprise-level RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous article, we analyzed in detail the core needs and challenges faced by the enterprise-level RAG system in the actual implementation process from multiple dimensions such as permission control, sharing methods, and security assurance. Next, we will integrate the above elements and propose a fully functional and implementable enterprise-level RAG construction idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Architecture diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](17_images/img20.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "​ This enterprise-level RAG system is mainly composed of user access, intent recognition, searcher, knowledge base, algorithm library, resequencer and large model modules. Users submit queries through the access module, and the request first passes through the intent recognition module, which determines the query intent and dynamically determines subsequent retrieval strategies. The retriever module is composed of multiple Retrievers and can flexibly call different knowledge bases and algorithm libraries to complete retrieval tasks with multiple strategies and multiple data sources. The knowledge base is used to store various structured or unstructured documents, and the algorithm library contains a variety of vectorization tools and parsers to support the encoding and processing of knowledge data. Both can be flexibly combined as needed. After the retrieval is completed, the candidate results are optimized for relevance by the re-ranking module, and then generated by a large language model (LLM) based on the optimized content, and finally output answers that meet user needs. The entire system design emphasizes module decoupling, flexible strategies, and enhanced generation, adapting to the needs of multi-user, high-concurrency, and multi-scenario enterprise applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Code implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, taking an e-commerce scenario as an example, we will build a RAG question and answer system with the above functions. A total of three knowledge bases are used in this example. The data preparation is as shown in the figure. The database construction method has been introduced in detail in Chapter 2 and will not be repeated here.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Technical Verification**: Please provide the device serial number and battery life test video (need to show the complete charge and discharge cycle). We will internally compare the promotional parameters through the tool [PERF_CHECK_V3].\n",

    "2. **Legal Assessment**: Trigger the legal system to automatically generate a \"Parameter Difference Analysis Report\", refer to case FC-2024-021 for detailed comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Solution**:\n",
    "- If the difference is ≤15%: We will give the user a 1-year extended warranty (service code SV-228).\n",
    "- If the difference is >15%: According to Article 23 of the Consumer Rights Protection Law, we will provide replacement or triple the price difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Communication skills: \"We attach great importance to the accuracy of product parameters and will entrust a third-party organization (such as SGS) to conduct retesting and give you a formal reply within 3 working days.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Article 23 of the \"Consumer Rights Protection Law\", the difference between the actual performance of the product and the advertised parameters exceeds the allowable error range of the industry standard (electronic equipment battery life error ±15%), which constitutes false advertising. Reference case FC-2024-021: A certain brand was sentenced to triple compensation for falsely marking the battery life of a smartwatch by 28%, and received an administrative penalty of 500,000 yuan from the Market Supervision Administration.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended that the technical department establish a standard process for battery life testing (which must comply with the GB/T 35143-2023 standard), and all promotional data must be accompanied by a description of the test environment (such as continuous use at 25°C in a laboratory environment).\n",

    "2. User: \"I would like to inquire whether the promotional content of the headphones is compliant.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "New question from user user2:\n",
    "\"Bone conduction headphones do not display patent numbers\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Assistant replied:\n",
    "According to the information provided, if the promotion of bone conduction headphones involves applied or authorized patented technology (such as bone conduction vibrator technology), but the patent number and patent type (invention, utility model or design) are not clearly marked, this may violate the requirements of Article 12 of the Advertising Law and relevant implementation rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a specific analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Patent number marking problem**\n",
    "- According to legal regulations, when mentioning patented technology in advertising, the patent number and patent type must be fully indicated. For example: \"This product uses bone conduction vibrator technology, patent number: ZL2024XXXXXXX, utility model patent.\"\n",
    "- If it only mentions \"patent applied for\" without specifying the specific patent number, it is illegal. Referring to the penalty case No. AD-2024-017, a technology company was fined 876,000 yuan for failing to indicate a patent number.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cross-border advertising requirements**\n",
    "- If the headset is promoted in cross-border markets (such as exported to other countries), the patent authorization country code (such as CN/EP/US) must also be marked simultaneously. For example: \"Patent number: ZL2024XXXXXXX, CN utility model patent.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Technical Exclusivity Statement Compliance**\n",
    "- Promotional copywriting must follow the \"three no's principles\":\n",
    "- Do not imply technological monopoly (avoid using absolute terms such as \"only\" and \"exclusive\").\n",
    "- Do not expand the scope of protection (ensure strict correspondence with the patent claims).\n",
    "- Do not conceal changes in patent status (if the patent is declared invalid, promotional materials must be updated within 3 working days).\n",
    "\n",
    "### suggestion\n",
    "- **Add patent information immediately**: clearly indicate the patent number and type in the promotion. If a patent application is pending, it should be noted as \"patent pending\" rather than directly stating \"patent applied for\".\n",
    "- **Avoid absolute terms**: Do not use expressions such as \"world-leading\" or \"unique\" to avoid the risk of false propaganda.\n",
    "- **Regularly check patent status**: Ensure that the promotional content is consistent with the actual patent status and updated in a timely manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are unable to provide a specific patent number or patent type, it is recommended to adjust the promotional copy first to avoid penalties for violations. For example, functional features could be described instead, such as \"Advanced bone conduction technology is used to achieve IPX7 waterproof performance.\"\n",
    "\n",

    "====================user1: User support issue follow-up ====================\n",
    "User user1 continues to ask:\n",
    "\"Are there any risks with this way of handling complaints?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Assistant replied:\n",
    "Although this processing method complies with laws, regulations and industry standards, it may still have the following potential risks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User trust is damaged**: If the battery life of the user's device varies greatly but does not exceed 15%, only providing extended warranty service may not be able to completely repair the user experience, thereby affecting brand faithfulness.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Test environment controversy**: Promotional data are usually based on laboratory conditions (such as continuous use at 25°C), while actual usage scenarios are complex and changeable (high temperature, low temperature, high load, etc.). If the user does not understand or agree with the test environment instructions, it may lead to further complaints.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Expanded legal risks**: If some products have false claims of battery life exceeding 15% and involve a large user group, they may be deemed to be systemic false propaganda and face class action lawsuits or more severe administrative penalties.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Technical verification efficiency issues**: Comparison through the tool [PERF_CHECK_V3] takes a certain amount of time. If the response speed is too slow, user dissatisfaction may escalate into a public opinion incident.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risk avoidance suggestions:\n",
    "- **Proactive optimization of publicity strategy**: Clearly indicate the battery life test environment (such as \"continuous use at 25°C in a laboratory environment\") on the product page and packaging, and add an explanation of possible differences in actual use.\n",
    "- **Establish a rapid response mechanism**: For battery life complaints, set up a special customer service team to ensure that preliminary assessments are completed and solutions are provided to users within 48 hours.\n",
    "- **Strengthen internal process control**: The technical department needs to regularly update the battery life test standard process to ensure compliance with the requirements of GB/T 35143-2023, and synchronize the test results with market promotions.\n",
    "- **Provide additional compensation measures**: For users whose battery life difference is close to a critical value, consider giving away accessories (such as chargers) or extending the warranty period to improve user satisfaction.\n",

    "According to the above log, we achieved:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Automatic intent recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "Through the **intent recognition** function, the RAG system can automatically analyze the user's questions and select the appropriate processing process (Pipeline). For example, when it receives user support questions, it combines the \"three-level response mechanism\" of the user support library to propose communication skills, and combines it with Article 23 of the \"Consumer Rights and Interests Protection Act\" of the regulations library to propose targeted legal regulations; when it receives product regulatory questions, it retrieves content related to bone conduction vibrator technology from the product library, and combines the technology exclusivity statement compliance-related content of the regulations library.\n",
    "\n",
    "This intent recognition function enables the system to respond to different types of problems more efficiently, and by automatically selecting the appropriate Pipeline, users' needs are quickly and accurately met, reducing the need for manual intervention and improving the overall response speed and service quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Joint retrieval of multiple knowledge bases\n",
    "\n",
    "In the assistant's answers, we can see the joint application of content from different knowledge bases. First of all, regarding complaints about smart watch battery life, the assistant not only provided specific test methods based on **technical documents**, but also quoted clauses and relevant cases in **legal knowledge base**, comprehensively covering multi-dimensional information such as product quality and consumer rights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, for headphone promotion compliance issues, the assistant combines content from the **Advertising Law** and **Patent Law** knowledge bases to provide detailed legal analysis and compliance suggestions. This demonstrates the flexibility and efficiency of RAG's capabilities in handling complex problems, providing precise answers through joint knowledge bases across multiple fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Separation of user history conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduce the user's historical conversations and separate them in your answers. For user user2's additional question (complaint handling method), by quoting historical conversations, the background understanding of the user's previous questions is ensured, and the accuracy and coherence of the answer are ensured.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Specify historical conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "A user's historical conversations can be explicitly specified to provide more personalized and granular responses. For example, when user2 inquires about headphone patent issues, the assistant provides relevant legal compliance answers based on the previous consultation content \"Is the promotional content of the headset compliant?\" and by introducing historical conversation data to ensure the pertinence and hierarchy of the answer, avoid repetitive answers, and strengthen the problem-solving path through suggestions such as \"supplementary patent information\"."
