    "> In the previous tutorial, we introduced how to improve the recall rate of the retrieval module through query rewriting, various optimized retrieval strategies, and recall rearrangement strategies. One of the key components that affects the quality of retrieved and recalled documents is similarity, which is used to calculate the similarity between the retrieved documents and the query query. The similarity calculation functions provided by LazyLLM by default are bm25 (divided into English and Chinese) similarity calculation and cosine similarity calculation methods. Among them, the bm25 algorithm mainly calculates text, while the cosine similarity algorithm mainly calculates embedding. If the default similarity calculation method provided by LazyLLM cannot meet your needs, you can design and define a similarity calculation method that meets your own needs. Similar to the Similarity component, this tutorial also introduces the custom methods of Transform."

In order to adapt to diverse needs, LazyLLM provides two general similarity calculation methods: BM25/BM25\\_chinese and cosine similarity.

    "1. **Timeliness**: The training data set of the large language model is as of a certain point in time, which means that subsequent events, new discoveries, new trends, or data updates will not be included in the model's knowledge base. Since model training requires huge computing resources and time, it is unrealistic to frequently update the model to include the latest information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Coverage**: Although the training data set of a large model is very large, it may still not cover all domain knowledge or in-depth information in a specific domain. For example, some specialized medical, legal, or technical issues may only be discussed in detail in specific literature that is not included in the model's training data.\n",

    "1. **Knowledge update limitations**: The knowledge of a large language model is based on the training data set, which means that its knowledge is limited and may not contain the latest information. By searching external knowledge bases, RAG can introduce the latest information to enhance the generated content.\n",

    "3. **Reduce misleading information**: Large models can sometimes generate inaccurate or misleading information. RAG helps reduce the generation of this misleading information by integrating retrieved accurate information.\n",

    "\n",
    "5. **Coping with unknown or sparse data**: For some specific domains or sparse data sets, large models may lack enough training data to generate high-quality output. RAG can help the model handle these situations better by retrieving knowledge in related fields.\n",

Valid values ​​for `join` are Boolean values ​​and string values. When `join` is `False`, it will only affect `output_format` to `content`, that is, the output content will not be spliced, but will be output in `List[str]` format. When `join` is `True`, `join` will be assigned an empty string.

They are both called mysteries, and mysteries are mysteries, and they are the door to all mysteries. \\nChapter 2\\nEveryone in the world knows that beauty is beautiful, but it is evil; \\nEveryone knows that good is good, but it is not good. \\nTherefore, presence and absence complement each other, difficulty and ease complement each other, long and short complement each other, high and low complement each other, sounds harmonize with each other, front and rear follow each other, and they are eternal. \\nThis is because the sage does nothing and teaches without saying anything. \\nEverything is created without beginning, born without being, done without relying on it, and accomplished without living. \\nI feel like I'm not living here, so I won't go. \\nChapter 3\\nIf you don't respect the virtuous, the people will not fight. \\nInexpensive and hard-to-find goods prevent people from stealing. \\nThere is no desire to be seen, so that the people's hearts are not in chaos. \\nThis is the rule of the sage: \\nIf the heart is empty, the belly is strong; if the ambition is weak, the bones are strong. \\nIt often makes the people ignorant and desireless, and makes people who know it dare not do anything. \\nIf you do nothing, everything will be cured. \\nChapter 4\\nIf you use it when the Tao rushes, it may not make a profit. \\nThe abyss is like the origin of all things, and the deep is like Ruexun. \\nI don’t know whose son is the first of Emperor Xiang. \\nChapter 5\\nHeaven and earth are unkind and regard all things as stupid dogs. \\nThe saint is unkind and treats the common people as stupid dogs. \\nBetween heaven and earth, is it still a mess? \\nIf it is empty but not yielding, it will get better when it moves. \\nIt is better to stay focused than to talk too much. \\nChapter 6\\nThe God of Grain is immortal and is called the mysterious female. \\nThe gate of Xuan Ni is called the root of heaven and earth. \\nIf it persists, it will not be used diligently. \\nChapter 7\\n forever. \\nThe reason why heaven and earth can last forever is because they do not generate themselves, so they can live forever. \\nThis means that the saint comes first after his body, and exists outside his body. \\nIt’s not because of his selflessness! \\nSo it can be done privately. \\nChapter 8\\nThe best is like water. \\nWater is good for all things without fighting.\\nIt is what everyone dislikes,\\nso it is close to the Tao. \\nLiving in a good place, having a good heart, being kind and benevolent, speaking good words and trustworthy, doing good government, doing good things, and doing good things at the right time. \\nThe husband does not fight, so there is no need for you. \\nChapter 9\\nIf you hold on to it and gain it, it will not be as good as it is; if you hold on to it and keep it sharp, you will not be able to maintain it for a long time. \\nIf a house is full of gold and jade, no one can guard it; if you are arrogant and rich, you will be blamed for it. \\nThe merit is then withdrawn, which is the way of heaven. \\nChapter 10\\nZai Ying Po hugs one, can we be inseparable. \\nSpecialized Qi makes it as soft as a baby. \\nIs it possible to eliminate all mysteries and make them flawless? \\nIf you love the people and govern the country, you can do nothing. \\nThe gate of heaven is open and closed, can it be a female? \\nIf you understand the Sida, you can be ignorant. \\nChapter 11\\nThirty spokes make up one hub. If it is not there, it can be used as a car. \\nThe clay is regarded as a utensil, but it should be used as a utensil if it is not there. \\nCut out a door to make a room. If it doesn't exist, use it as a room. \\nTherefore, if you have it, you will benefit from it, and if you don’t have it, you will use it.

Those who see them will prosper. \\nThe five thieves are in the heart and execute them in heaven. \\nThe universe depends on the hands, and everything depends on the body. \\nIt is human nature and scheming. The way of establishing heaven is used to determine people. \\nThe sky sends murderous intentions, and the stars move to their places; the earth sends murderous intentions, and dragons and snakes rise from the ground; humans send murderous intentions, and heaven and earth turn over and over again; heaven and man unite, and everything is established. \\nSex is cunning and can be hidden. The evil of the nine orifices depends on the three essentials, which can cause movement and stillness. \\nFire is born in wood, and disaster will be overcome; treachery is born in a country, and it will collapse in time. Those who know how to practice are called saints. \\nHe is born to be killed by nature, which is the principle of Tao. The thief of all things in heaven and earth, the thief of all things by man, the thief of man and all things. The three thieves are both suitable and the three talents are safe. \\nTherefore, it is said that if you eat at the right time, everything will be in order; if you use its mechanism, everything will be at peace. People know the gods of their gods, but they don’t know the reason why they are gods. \\nThe sun and the moon are numbered, the size is determined, the divine power is born, and the gods are born. \\nNo one in the world can see or know about his stolen machine. A gentleman will have a firm bow, while a villain will have a light life. \\nThe blind person is good at hearing, and the deaf person is good at seeing. One source of absolute profit, use the teacher ten times. Return to day and night three times, and use your troops ten thousand times. \\nThe heart is born from things and dies from things. The machine is in the eyes. \\nHeaven is unkind but has great kindness. Thunder and strong wind are all stupid. \\nThe most joyful nature, the most tranquil nature and incorruptibility. Heaven is supremely private, and its use is supremely public. \\nThe control of birds lies in Qi. The living is the root of death, and the dead is the root of life. Grace is born from harm, harm is born from grace. \\nFools regard heaven and earth, culture and science as sages, I regard time, objects, culture and philosophy as sages.

Those who see them will prosper. \\nThe five thieves are in the heart and execute them in heaven. \\nThe universe depends on the hands, and everything depends on the body. \\nIt is human nature and scheming. The way of establishing heaven is used to determine people. \\nThe sky sends murderous intentions, and the stars move to their places; the earth sends murderous intentions, and dragons and snakes rise from the ground; humans send murderous intentions, and heaven and earth turn over and over again; heaven and man unite, and everything is established. \\nSex is cunning and can be hidden. The evil of the nine orifices depends on the three essentials, which can cause movement and stillness. \\nFire is born in wood, and disaster will be overcome; treachery is born in a country, and it will collapse in time. Those who know how to practice are called saints. \\nHe is born to be killed by nature, which is the principle of Tao. The thief of all things in heaven and earth, the thief of all things by man, the thief of man and all things. The three thieves are both suitable and the three talents are safe. \\nTherefore, it is said that if you eat at the right time, everything will be in order; if you use its mechanism, everything will be at peace. People know the gods of their gods, but they don’t know the reason why they are gods. \\nThe sun and the moon are numbered, the size is determined, the divine power is born, and the gods are born. \\nNo one in the world can see or know about his stolen machine. A gentleman will have a firm bow, while a villain will have a light life. \\nThe blind person is good at hearing, and the deaf person is good at seeing. One source of absolute profit, use the teacher ten times. Return to day and night three times, and use your troops ten thousand times. \\nThe heart is born from things and dies from things. The machine is in the eyes. \\nHeaven is unkind but has great kindness. Thunder and strong wind are all stupid. \\nThe most joyful nature, the most tranquil nature and incorruptibility. Heaven is supremely private, and its use is supremely public. \\nThe control of birds lies in Qi. The living is the root of death, and the dead is the root of life. Grace is born from harm, harm is born from grace. \\nFools regard heaven and earth, culture and science as sages, I regard time, objects, culture and philosophy as sages. ', 'Destiny is called nature, nature is called Tao, and cultivating Tao is called teaching. \\nThe Tao cannot be separated in a moment (yú); it can be separated, but it is not the Tao. Therefore, a gentleman should be cautious about what he does not see and be afraid of what he does not hear. Don't see (xian) what is hidden, don't show what is subtle, so a gentleman should be cautious about being alone. \\nWhen joy, anger, sorrow, and joy have not arisen, it is called the middle; when they arise, they are all in the middle, it is called the harmony. The one who is in the middle is the foundation of the world; the one who is in harmony is the way of the world. To achieve neutrality, the heaven will have its place and all things will be nurtured. \\n\\nZhongni said: \"A gentleman is the mean, and a villain is against the mean. A gentleman is in the mean, and a gentleman is in the middle at all times; a villain is against the mean, and a villain has no scruples.\"\\n\\nConfucius said: \"The mean is the end! People rarely last long. ! \"\\n\\nConfucius said: \"I know that the way is not good: those who know it can't do it, and the fool can't do it. I know that the way can't be done; the wise person can't do it, and the unworthy person can't do it.\"', 'Chapter 1\\nThe Tao can be Tao, but it is very Tao. \\nThe name can be named, but it is very famous. \\nNothing is called the beginning of heaven and earth; Being is called the mother of all things. \\nTherefore, if there is always nothing, I want to observe its wonderfulness; if there is always something, I want to observe its beauty. \\nThe two have the same origin but different names. They are both called mysteries, and mysteries are mysteries, and they are the door to all mysteries. \\nChapter 2\\nEveryone in the world knows that beauty is beautiful, but it is evil; \\nEveryone knows that good is good, but it is not good. \\nTherefore, presence and absence complement each other, difficulty and ease complement each other, long and short complement each other, high and low complement each other, sounds harmonize with each other, front and rear follow each other, and they are eternal. \\nThis is because the sage does nothing and teaches without saying anything. \\nEverything is created without beginning, born without being, done without relying on it, and accomplished without living. \\nI feel like I'm not living here, so I won't go. \\nChapter 3\\nIf you don't respect the virtuous, the people will not fight. \\nInexpensive and hard-to-find goods prevent people from stealing. \\nThere is no desire to be seen, so that the people's hearts are not in chaos. \\nThis is the rule of the sage: \\nIf the heart is empty, the belly is strong; if the ambition is weak, the bones are strong. \\nIt often makes the people ignorant and desireless, and makes people who know it dare not do anything. \\nIf you do nothing, everything will be cured. \\nChapter 4\\nIf you use it when the Tao rushes, it may not make a profit. \\nThe abyss is like the origin of all things, and the deep is like Ruexun. \\nI don’t know whose son is the first of Emperor Xiang. \\nChapter 5\\nHeaven and earth are unkind and regard all things as stupid dogs. \\nThe saint is unkind and treats the common people as stupid dogs. \\nBetween heaven and earth, is it still a mess? \\nIf it is empty but not yielding, it will get better when it moves. \\nIt is better to stay focused than to talk too much. \\nChapter 6\\nThe God of Grain is immortal and is called the mysterious female. \\nThe gate of Xuan Ni is called the root of heaven and earth. \\nIf it persists, it will not be used diligently. \\nChapter 7\\nForever. \\nThe reason why heaven and earth can last forever is because they do not generate themselves, so they can live forever. \\nThis means that the saint comes first after his body, and exists outside his body. \\nIt’s not because of his selflessness! \\nSo it can be done privately. \\nChapter 8\\nThe best is like water. \\nWater is good for all things without fighting.\\nIt is what everyone dislikes,\\nso it is close to the Tao. \\nLiving in a good place, having a good heart, being kind and benevolent, speaking good words and trustworthy, doing good government, doing good things, and doing good things at the right time. \\nThe husband does not fight, so there is no need for you. \\nChapter 9\\nIf you hold on to it and gain it, it will not be as good as it is; if you hold on to it and keep it sharp, you will not be able to maintain it for a long time. \\nIf a house is full of gold and jade, no one can guard it; if you are arrogant and rich, you will be blamed for it. \\nThe merit is then withdrawn, which is the way of heaven. \\nChapter 10\\nZai Ying Po hugs one, can we be inseparable. \\nSpecialized Qi makes it as soft as a baby. \\nIs it possible to eliminate all mysteries and make them flawless? \\nIf you love the people and govern the country, you can do nothing. \\nThe gate of heaven is open and closed, can it be a female? \\nIf you understand the Sida, you can be ignorant. \\nChapter 11\\nThirty spokes make up one hub. If it is not there, it can be used as a car. \\nThe clay is regarded as a utensil, but it should be used as a utensil if it is not there. \\nCut out a door to make a room. If it doesn't exist, use it as a room. \\nTherefore, if you have it, you will benefit from it, and if you don’t have it, you will use it. ']\n",

Those who see them will prosper. \\nThe five thieves are in the heart and execute them in heaven. \\nThe universe depends on the hands, and everything depends on the body. \\nIt is human nature and scheming. The way of establishing heaven is used to determine people. \\nThe sky sends murderous intentions, and the stars move to their places; the earth sends murderous intentions, and dragons and snakes rise from the ground; humans send murderous intentions, and heaven and earth turn over and over again; heaven and man unite, and everything is established. \\nSex is cunning and can be hidden. The evil of the nine orifices depends on the three essentials, which can cause movement and stillness. \\nFire is born in wood, and disaster will be overcome; treachery is born in a country, and it will collapse in time. Those who know how to practice are called saints. \\nHe is born to be killed by nature, which is the principle of Tao. The thief of all things in heaven and earth, the thief of all things by man, the thief of man and all things. The three thieves are both suitable and the three talents are safe. \\nTherefore, it is said that if you eat at the right time, everything will be in order; if you use its mechanism, everything will be at peace. People know the gods of their gods, but they don’t know the reason why they are gods. \\nThe sun and the moon are numbered, the size is determined, the divine power is born, and the gods are born. \\nNo one in the world can see or know about his stolen machine. A gentleman will have a firm bow, while a villain will have a light life. \\nThe blind person is good at hearing, and the deaf person is good at seeing. One source of absolute profit, use the teacher ten times. Return to day and night three times, and use your troops ten thousand times. \\nThe heart is born from things and dies from things. The machine is in the eyes. \\nHeaven is unkind but has great kindness. Thunder and strong wind are all stupid. \\nThe most joyful nature, the most tranquil nature and incorruptibility. Heaven is supremely private, and its use is supremely public. \\nThe control of birds lies in Qi. The living is the root of death, and the dead is the root of life. Grace is born from harm, harm is born from grace. \\nFools regard heaven and earth, culture and science as sages, I regard time, objects, culture and philosophy as sages.
